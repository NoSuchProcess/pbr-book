<h2>Further Reading</h2><p>


</p>
<p>The books by McCluney (<a href="#cite:McCluney94">1994</a>) and Malacara (<a href="#cite:Malacara02">2002</a>) discuss blackbody emitters
and the standard illuminants in detail.  Wilkie and Weidlich (<a href="#cite:Wilkie2011">2011</a>) noted
that common practice in rendering has been to use the blackbody
distribution of Equation&nbsp;(<a href="../Light_Sources/Light_Emission.html#eq:plancks-law">12.1</a>) to model light emission for
rendering, while Kirchoff&rsquo;s law, Equation&nbsp;(<a href="../Light_Sources/Light_Emission.html#eq:kirchoffs-law">12.4</a>), would
be more accurate.  They also point out that as objects become hot, their
BRDFs often change, which makes Kirchoff&rsquo;s law more difficult to adopt,
especially in that models that account for the effect of temperature
variation on BRDFs generally aren&rsquo;t available.

</p>
<p>The Standard Illuminants are defined in a CIE Technical Report (<a href="#cite:Report2004">2004</a>); Judd et&nbsp;al. (<a href="#cite:Judd1964">1964</a>) developed the approach that was used to define the D Standard
Illuminant.

</p>
<p>Warn (<a href="#cite:Warn83">1983</a>) developed early models of light sources with nonisotropic
emission distributions, including the spotlight model used in this chapter.
Verbeck and Greenberg (<a href="#cite:Verbeck:1984:ACL">1984</a>) also described a number of techniques for
modeling light sources that are now classic parts of the light modeling
toolbox.  Barzel (<a href="#cite:Barzel97">1997</a>) described a highly parameterized
model for light sources, including many controls for controlling rate of
falloff, the area of space that is illuminated, and so on.  Bjorke (<a href="#cite:Bjorke01">2001</a>)
described a number of additional controls for controlling illumination for
artistic effect.  (Many parts of the Barzel and Bjorke approaches are not
physically based, however.)

</p>
<p>The goniometric light source approximation is widely used to model area
light sources in the field of illumination engineering.  The rule of thumb
there is that once a reference point is five times an area light source&rsquo;s
radius away from it, a point light approximation has sufficient accuracy
for most applications.  File format standards have been developed for
encoding goniophotometric diagrams for these applications (Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America&nbsp;<a href="#cite:IESNA2002">2002</a>). Many lighting fixture
manufacturers provide data in these formats on their Web sites.

</p>
<p>Ashdown (<a href="#cite:Ashdown:1993:NPA">1993</a>) proposed a more sophisticated light source model than
goniometric diagrams; he measured the directional distribution of emitted
radiance at a large number of points around a light source and described
how to use the resulting 4D table to compute the received radiance
distribution at other points.  Another generalization of goniometric lights
was suggested by Heidrich et&nbsp;al. (<a href="#cite:Heidrich98a">1998</a>), who represented light sources as a
4D exitant <em>lightfield</em>&mdash;essentially a function of both position and
direction&mdash;and showed how to use this representation for rendering.
Additional work in this area was done by Goesele et&nbsp;al. (<a href="#cite:Goesele2003">2003</a>), who further
investigated issues in measuring light sources, and Mas et&nbsp;al. (<a href="#cite:Mas2008">2008</a>), who
introduced a more space-efficient representation and improved rendering
efficiency.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Real-world light sources are often fairly complex, including carefully
designed systems of mirrors and lenses to shape the distribution of light
emitted by the light source.  (Consider, for example, the headlights on a
car, where it&rsquo;s important to evenly illuminate the surface of the road,
without shining too much light in the eyes of approaching drivers.)  As
we&rsquo;ll see in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="../Light_Transport_III_Bidirectional_Methods.html#chap:bidir-methods">16</a>, all of this specular reflection and transmission
is challenging for light transport algorithms. It can therefore be
worthwhile to do some precomputation to create a representation of light
sources&rsquo; final emission distributions after all of this scattering that is
then used as the light source model for rendering.
To this end, Kniep et&nbsp;al. (<a href="#cite:Kniep2009">2009</a>) suggest tracing the paths of photons
leaving the light&rsquo;s filament until they hit a bounding surface around the
light. They then record the position and direction of outgoing photons and
use this information when computing illumination at points in the scene.
Vel&aacute;zquez-Armend&aacute;riz et&nbsp;al. (<a href="#cite:xEntityList:Velcmd::azquez-Armendcmd::ariz2015">2015</a>) showed how to compute a set of
point lights with
directionally varying emission distributions to model emitted radiance from
complex light sources.  They then approximated the radiance distribution in
the light interior using spherical harmonics.

</p>
<p>Blinn and Newell (<a href="#cite:Blinn76">1976</a>) first introduced the idea of environment maps and
their use for simulating illumination, although they only considered
illumination of specular objects.  Greene (<a href="#cite:Greene86b">1986</a>) further refined these
ideas, considering antialiasing and different representations for
environment maps.  Nishita and Nakamae (<a href="#cite:Nishita:1986:CTR">1986</a>) developed algorithms for
efficiently rendering objects illuminated by hemispherical skylights and
generated some of the first images that showed off that distinctive
lighting effect.  Miller and Hoffman (<a href="#cite:Miller84">1984</a>) were the first to consider
using arbitrary environment maps to illuminate objects with diffuse and
glossy BRDFs.  Debevec (<a href="#cite:Debevec98">1998</a>) later extended this work and investigated
issues related to capturing images of real environments.

</p>
<p>Representing illumination from the sun and sky is a particularly important
application of infinite light sources; the &ldquo;Further Reading&rdquo; section in
Chapter&nbsp;<a href="../Light_Transport_II_Volume_Rendering.html#chap:volume-integration">15</a> includes a number of references related to simulating skylight
scattering.  Directly measuring illumination from the sky is also an effective
way to find accurate skylight illumination; see Kider et&nbsp;al. (<a href="#cite:Kider2014">2014</a>) for
details of a system they built to do this.  (A companion Web site has a
large amount of measured skylight data available for download.)

</p>
<p><tt>pbrt</tt>&rsquo;s infinite area light source models incident radiance from the light
as purely a function of direction.  Especially for indoor scenes, this
assumption can be fairly inaccurate; position matters as well.  Unger et&nbsp;al. (<a href="#cite:Unger2003">2003</a>) captured the incident radiance as a function of direction at
many different locations in a real-world scene and used this representation
for rendering.  Unger et&nbsp;al. (<a href="#cite:Unger2008">2008</a>) improved on this work and showed how to
decimate the samples to reduce storage requirements without introducing too
much error.

</p>
<p>As discussed in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="../Shapes.html#chap:shapes">3</a>, one way to reduce the time spent tracing shadow
rays is to have methods like <a href="../Shapes/Basic_Shape_Interface.html#Shape::IntersectP"><tt>Shape::IntersectP()</tt></a> and
<a href="../Primitives_and_Intersection_Acceleration/Primitive_Interface_and_Geometric_Primitives.html#Primitive::IntersectP"><tt>Primitive::IntersectP()</tt></a> that just check for any occlusion along a ray
without bothering to compute the geometric information at the intersection
point.  Other approaches for optimizing ray tracing for shadow rays include
the <em>shadow cache</em>, where each light stores a pointer to the last
primitive that occluded a shadow ray to the light. That primitive is
checked first to see if it occludes subsequent shadow rays before the ray
is passed to the acceleration structure (<a href="#cite:Haines86">Haines and Greenberg 1986</a>).  Pearce (<a href="#cite:Pearce91">1991</a>)
pointed out that the shadow cache doesn&rsquo;t work well if the scene has finely
tessellated geometry; it may be better to cache the BVH node that
held the last occluder, for instance.  (The shadow cache can similarly be
defeated when multiple levels of reflection and refraction are present or
when Monte Carlo ray-tracing techniques are used.)  Hart, Dutr&eacute;, and Greenberg (<a href="#cite:Hart99">1999</a>) developed a generalization of the shadow cache, which
tracks which objects block light from particular light sources and clips
their geometry against the light source geometry so that shadow rays don&rsquo;t
need to be traced toward the parts of the light that are certain to be
occluded.

</p>
<p>A related technique, described by Haines and Greenberg (<a href="#cite:Haines86">1986</a>), is the light
buffer for point light sources, where the light discretizes the directions
around it and determines which objects are visible along each set of
directions (and are thus potential occluding objects for shadow rays).
Another effective optimization is <em>shaft culling</em>, which takes
advantage of coherence among groups of rays traced in a similar set of
directions (e.g., shadow rays from a single point to points on an area
light source).  With shaft culling, a shaft that bounds a collection of
rays is computed and then the objects in the scene that penetrate the shaft
are found.  For all of the rays in the shaft, it is only necessary to check
for intersections with those objects that intersect the shaft, and the
expense of ray intersection acceleration structure traversal for each of
the rays is avoided (<a href="#cite:Haines94">Haines and Wallace 1994</a>).

</p>
<p>Woo and Amanatides (<a href="#cite:Woo:1990:VOT">1990</a>) classified which lights are visible, not visible, and
partially visible in different parts of the scene and stored this
information in a voxel-based 3D data structure, using this
information to save shadow ray tests.  Fernandez, Bala, and Greenberg (<a href="#cite:Fernandez:2002:LIE">2002</a>)
developed a similar approach based on spatial decomposition that stores
references to important blockers in each voxel and also builds up this
information on demand for applications like
walkthroughs.

</p>
<p>For complex models, simplified versions of their geometry can be used for
shadow ray intersections.  For example, the simplification envelopes
described by Cohen et al. (<a href="#cite:Cohen96">1996</a>) can create a simplified mesh that
bounds a given mesh from both the inside and the outside.  If a ray misses
the mesh that bounds a complex model from the outside or intersects the
mesh that bounds it from the inside, then no further shadow processing is
necessary.  Only the uncertain remaining cases need to be intersected
against the full geometry.  A related technique is described by
Lukaszewski (<a href="#cite:Lukaszewski01">2001</a>), who uses the Minkowski sum to effectively expand primitives
(or bounds of primitives) in the scene so that intersecting one ray against
one of these primitives can determine if any of a collection of rays might
have intersected the actual primitives.
