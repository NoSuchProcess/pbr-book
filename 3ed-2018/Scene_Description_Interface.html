</p>
<p>This appendix describes the application programming interface (API) that is
used to describe the scene to be rendered to <tt>pbrt</tt>.  Users of the renderer
typically don&rsquo;t call the functions in this interface directly but instead
describe their scenes using the text file format described in documentation
on the <tt>pbrt</tt> Web site (<a href="http://pbrt.org">pbrt.org</a>).  The statements in these text files
have a direct correspondence to the API functions described here.

</p>
<p>The need for such an interface to the renderer is clear: there must be a
convenient way in which all of the properties of the scene to be rendered can
be communicated to the renderer.  The interface should be well defined and
general purpose, so that future extensions to the system fit into its structure
cleanly.  It shouldn&rsquo;t be too complicated, so that it&rsquo;s easy to describe
scenes, but it should be expressive enough that it doesn&rsquo;t leave any of the
renderer&rsquo;s capabilities hidden.

</p>
<p>A key decision to make when designing a rendering API is whether to expose the
system&rsquo;s internal algorithms and structures or offer a high-level abstraction
for describing the scene.  These have historically been the two main approaches to scene
description in graphics: the interface may specify <em>how</em> to render the
scene, configuring a rendering pipeline at a low level using deep knowledge of
the renderer&rsquo;s internal algorithms, or it may specify <em>what</em> the scene&rsquo;s
objects, lights, and material properties are and leave it to the renderer to
decide how to transform that description into the best possible image.

</p>
<p>The first approach has been successfully used for interactive graphics.  In
APIs such as OpenGL&reg; or Direct3D&reg;, it is not
possible to just mark an object as a
mirror and have reflections appear automatically; rather, the user must choose
an algorithm for rendering reflections, render the scene multiple times
(e.g.,
to generate an environment map), store those images in a texture, and then
configure the graphics pipeline to use the environment map when rendering the
reflective object.  The advantage of this approach is that the full flexibility
of the rendering pipeline is exposed to the user, making it possible to
carefully control the actual computation being done and to use the pipeline
very efficiently.  Furthermore, because APIs like these impose a very thin
abstraction layer between the user and the renderer, the user can be confident
that unexpected inefficiencies won&rsquo;t be introduced by the API.

</p>
<p>The second approach to scene description, based on describing the geometry,
materials, and lights at a higher level of abstraction, has been most
successful for applications like high-quality offline rendering.  There,
users are generally willing to cede control of the low-level rendering
details to the renderer in exchange for the ability to specify the scene&rsquo;s
properties at a high level.  An important advantage of the high-level
approach is that the implementations of these renderers have greater
freedom to make major changes to the internal algorithms of the system,
since the API exposes less of them.

</p>
<p>For <tt>pbrt</tt>, we will use an interface based on the descriptive approach.  Because
<tt>pbrt</tt> is fundamentally physically based, the API is necessarily less flexible in
some ways than APIs for many nonphysically based rendering packages.  For
example, it is not possible to have some lights illuminate only some objects
in the scene.

</p>
<p>Another key decision to make in graphics API design is whether to use an
immediate mode or a retained mode style.  In an immediate mode API, the user
specifies the scene via a stream of commands that the renderer processes as
they arrive.  In general, the user cannot make changes to the scene
description data already specified (e.g., &ldquo;change the material of that sphere I
described previously from plastic to glass&rdquo;); once it has been given to the
renderer, the information is no longer accessible to the user.  Retained mode
APIs give the user some degree of access to the data structures that the
renderer has built to represent the scene.  The user can then modify the scene description in a
variety of ways before finally instructing the renderer to render the scene.

</p>
<p>Immediate mode has been very successful for interactive graphics APIs since
it allows graphics hardware to draw the objects in the scene as they are
supplied by the user.  Since they do not need to build data structures to
store the scene and since they can apply techniques like immediately
culling objects that are outside of the viewing frustum without worrying
that the user will change the camera position before rendering, these APIs
have been key to high-performance interactive graphics.

</p>
<p>For ray-tracing-based renderers like <tt>pbrt</tt>, where the entire scene must be
described and stored in memory before rendering can begin, some of these
advantages of an immediate mode interface aren&rsquo;t applicable.  Nonetheless, we
will use immediate mode semantics in our API, since it leads to a clean and
straightforward scene description language.  This choice makes it more
difficult to use <tt>pbrt</tt> for applications like quickly rerendering a scene after
making a small change to it (e.g., by moving a light source) and may make
rendering animations less straightforward, since the entire scene needs to be
redescribed for each frame of an animation.  Adding a retained mode interface
to <tt>pbrt</tt> would be a challenging but useful project.

</p>
<p><tt>pbrt</tt>&rsquo;s rendering API consists of just over 40 carefully chosen functions,
all of which are declared in the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/tree/master/src/core/api.h"><tt>core/api.h</tt></a> header file.  The
implementation of these functions is in <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/tree/master/src/core/api.cpp"><tt>core/api.cpp</tt></a>.  This appendix
will focus on the general process of turning the API function calls into
instances of the classes that represent scenes.
