<h1> Preface to the Online Edition</h1><p>


</p>
<p>When the first edition of of <em>Physically Based Rendering</em> was released
in 2004, it was only available in print form.  The second edition, in 2010,
featured a Kindle edition in addition to the printed book, though
unfortunately all of the cross-referencing and indexing that makes the book
useful was lost in translation.  Finally the third edition, released in
2016, featured both a good Kindle translation as well as PDF version of the
book.  While the digital versions of the book showed improvement, we felt
that they were still far from their potential.

</p>
<p>The heart of <em>Physically Based Rendering</em> is the fact that it&rsquo;s a
literate program.  Literate programming, one of Donald Knuth&rsquo;s many great
ideas, is an approach to writing software that focuses more on humans
reading source code for illumination than on computers translating source
code into executable instructions.  Literate programming is about
decomposing complex programs into understandable pieces and providing a
multitude of ways to cross-reference those pieces and understand what goes
into each one of them.

</p>
<p>With a literate program presented on paper, each page is dense with
auxiliary information, all of it using page numbers for direction.  There
are indices in the margins with references to the pages where identifiers
used in that page&rsquo;s code are defined, and each code fragment has page
numbers denoting where other parts of it are defined and where it is used.

</p>
<p>That format has proven itself to be effective, but it&rsquo;s awfully
chatty with the page numbers.  Further, it&rsquo;s a bother to flip through a
book in search of a specific page.  We always wondered what sort of
experience of reading the book we might developed if we targeted computing
devices&mdash;desktops and laptops, tablets, and maybe even phones&mdash;as the
main delivery vehicle for the book&rsquo;s content.  No more page numbers
everywhere, but instead hyperlinks, taking the reader directly to their
destination and easy enough to return from back to where the reader was.

</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just navigation that&rsquo;s improved: modern displays have much better
color fidelity and dynamic range than the printed page, and having a
computer in the mix allows the possibility of interaction with the books&rsquo;
illustrations.  These are both wonderful characteristics for a book that is
all about images and the three-dimensional world.

</p>
<p>Over the summer of 2018, we were able to secure the rights to the book text
from the book&rsquo;s publisher; we are extremely grateful for their generosity
in returning them to us.  With that, we were free to make the choice of
whether we&rsquo;d try this new way of presenting the book&rsquo;s contents.  We took
it.  Over the course of a month or so of feverish hacking, we implemented a
system that translates from the markup language we used to write the book
into HTML.  You&rsquo;re reading the result.

</p>
<p>This online version of the book corresponds closely to the third edition of
<em>Physically Based Rendering</em>.  The only changes we made were:
</p>
<ul>
<li> updating some of the rendered images used in figures,
<li> adding interaction to image viewing,
<li> redrawing all of the illustrations,
<li> merging some figure sequences that compared multiple renderings of a scene
into a single figure, and
<li> incorporating errata reported by readers.
</ul><p>


</p>
<p>The first two changes merit further explanation.  Regarding the updated
images: one of the challenges with the printed version of the book was
making sure that image artifacts like Monte Carlo noise would be visible on
the page; we worried that printing would introduce unwanted blur, and we
also always worried that somewhere in the production process, a
well-meaning person would denoise the images to make them look cleaner,
thinking that an improvement.  Therefore, we upscaled images that were
supposed to show errors with nearest filtering to ensure that errors would
make their way through the printing process.

</p>
<p>Now, there are no such worries.  It was a delight to re-render those
images, leaving them now with single-pixel-sized errors.

</p>
<p>The second change marks our first step toward interactive exploration of
the content: in a Web browser, it&rsquo;s possible to investigate the details of
rendered images and their differences in ways that aren&rsquo;t possible in a
printed book.  Most rendered images in the online edition can be zoomed
into, viewed full screen, and compared with other images.  They are all
marked with this icon: <i class="fa fa-snowflake fa-border
yojeri"></i>. Hover over that icon with your pointer for more details
about what&rsquo;s possible with them.

<h3>Road Map</h3><p>


</p>
<p>We plan to release updated versions of the book roughly once a year,
starting a year or so from now.  While the online format makes it possible
update the book even more frequently than is possible with a print version,
we think that releasing updates at a measured pace will allow for
careful review and editing before new text is posted online.

</p>
<p>Beyond extending the functionality of <tt>pbrt</tt> to keep pace with the latest
research, we also plan to add more interactive elements to the reading
experience in upcoming versions. The <a href="http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html">Immersive Linear
 Algebra</a> book by Str&ouml;m,
&#8491;str&ouml;m and Akenine-M&ouml;ller is an inspiration for what&rsquo;s possible
with this medium.

</p>
<p>We will keep previous versions of the book online, with the same URLs as
when they were first posted; new versions will be in separate directories.
Thus, it&rsquo;s safe to link to content here without worrying about broken links
in the future.

<h3>Reporting Bugs</h3><p>


</p>
<p>As with earlier versions of the book, please send an email to
<em>authors@pbrt.org</em> if you see any errors in the text or in the online
conversion of it.  Note that we often let a few months of bug reports
accumulate before processing them; it takes a surprising amount of focus to
work through many of them and therefore we usually batch them up.  As such,
please don&rsquo;t be offended if it&rsquo;s some time before we respond to your email;
do know that we very much appreciate corrections and suggestions from
readers.

</p>
<p>We have tested this site with a variety of Web browsers on a variety of
platforms, spanning desktop computers to tablets and phones.  The site is
best viewed on a device that is at least 768 pixels wide; while the Web
pages should all render correctly on smaller devices, we haven&rsquo;t worked to
polish the experience on them.

</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> please don&rsquo;t bother submitting bug reports for missing
cross-referencing links in the source code; we know there&rsquo;s polishing to be
done there. Please do report any broken links or incorrect links.

</p>
<p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3><p>


</p>
<p>In addition to informing us of any errors you may find in the book, we&rsquo;re
particularly interested in feedback about the experience of reading the
book on the Web.  On a related note, we&rsquo;ve tried to keep accessibility in
mind as in the production of the Web site, but would particularly
appreciate feedback about that part of the experience.

</p>
<p>There are some monetary costs in providing this content online.  While
bandwidth is fairly inexpensive, it&rsquo;s not free, especially with so many
high-resolution images.  Further, in order to maintain a high level of
quality, we would like to continue to work with professional copy-editors,
proofreaders, and illustrators as we add more content to the book.  If you
have the ability and the inclination to help support this project
financially, we&rsquo;ve set up a <a href="https://patreon.com/pbrbook">patreon</a>;
we&rsquo;re grateful for any contribution.
