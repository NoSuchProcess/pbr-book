<h2>17.1 Design Retrospective</h2><p>


</p>
<p>One of the basic assumptions in <tt>pbrt</tt>&rsquo;s design was that the most
interesting types of images to render are images with complex geometry and
lighting and that supporting a wide variety of shapes, materials, light
sources, and light transport algorithms was important.  We also assumed
that rendering these images well&mdash;with good sampling patterns, ray
differentials, and antialiased textures&mdash;is worth the computational
expense.  One result of these assumptions is that <tt>pbrt</tt> is relatively
inefficient at rendering simple scenes, where a more specialized
system could do much better.

</p>
<p>For example, a performance implication of our design priorities is that
finding the BSDF at a ray intersection is more computationally expensive
than it is in renderers that don&rsquo;t expend as much effort filtering textures
and computing ray differentials.  We believe that this effort pays off
overall by reducing the need to trace more camera rays to address texture
aliasing, although, again, for simple scenes, texture aliasing is often not
a problem. 
On the other hand, most of the integrators in <tt>pbrt</tt> assume that hundreds
or even thousands of samples will be taken in each pixel for high-quality
global illumination; the benefits of high quality filtering are reduced in
this case, since the high pixel sampling rate ends up sampling textures at
a high rate as well.

</p>
<p>The simplicity of some of the interfaces in the system can lead to
unnecessary work being done.  For example, the <a href="../Sampling_and_Reconstruction/Sampling_Interface.html#Sampler"><tt>Sampler</tt></a> always
computes lens and time samples, even if they aren&rsquo;t needed by the
<a href="../Camera_Models/Camera_Model.html#Camera"><tt>Camera</tt></a>; there&rsquo;s no way for the <a href="../Camera_Models/Camera_Model.html#Camera"><tt>Camera</tt></a> to communicate its
sampling needs.  Similarly, if an <a href="../Introduction/pbrt_System_Overview.html#Integrator"><tt>Integrator</tt></a> doesn&rsquo;t use all of the
array samples from its earlier calls to
<a href="../Sampling_and_Reconstruction/Sampling_Interface.html#Sampler::Request1DArray"><tt>Request1DArray()</tt></a> and
<a href="../Sampling_and_Reconstruction/Sampling_Interface.html#Sampler::Request2DArray"><tt>Request2DArray()</tt></a> for some ray,
then the <a href="../Sampling_and_Reconstruction/Sampling_Interface.html#Sampler"><tt>Sampler</tt></a>&rsquo;s work for generating those samples is wasted.  (This
case can occur, for example, if the ray doesn&rsquo;t intersect any geometry.)
For cases like these, we believe that the benefits to readers of making the
system easier to understand outweigh the relatively small efficiency
losses.

</p>
<p>Throughout the book, we have tried to always add an exercise at the end of
the chapter when we&rsquo;ve known that there was an important design alternative
or where we made an implementation trade-off that would likely be made
differently in a production rendering system.  (For example,
Exercise&nbsp;7.2 discusses the first issue with <tt>Sampler</tt>s in the previous
paragraph.)  It&rsquo;s worth reading the exercises even if you don&rsquo;t plan to do
them.

</p>
<p>Another instance where the chosen abstractions in <tt>pbrt</tt> impact the overall
system efficiency is the range of geometric primitives that the renderer
supports.  While ray tracing&rsquo;s ability to handle a wide variety of shapes
is elegant, this property is not as useful in practice as one might
initially expect.  Most real-world scenes are either modeled directly with
polygons or with smooth surfaces like spline patches and subdivision
surfaces that either have difficult-to-implement or relatively inefficient
ray&ndash;shape intersection algorithms.  As such, they are usually tessellated
into triangles for ray intersection tests in practice.  Not many shapes
that are commonly encountered in real-world scenes can be represented
accurately with spheres and cones!

</p>
<p>There are some advantages to designing a ray tracer around a single
low-level shape representation like triangles and only operating on this
representation throughout much of the pipeline.  Such a renderer could
still support a variety of primitives in the scene description but would
always tessellate them at some point before performing intersection tests.
Advantages of this design include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The renderer can depend on the fact that the triangle vertices can be
transformed into world or camera space in advance, so no transformations of rays
into object space are necessary (except when object instancing is used).

<li> The acceleration structures can be specialized so that their nodes
directly store the triangles that overlap them.  This improves the locality
of the geometry in memory and enables ray&ndash;primitive intersection tests to
be performed directly in the traversal routine, without needing to pass
through two levels of virtual function calls to do so, as is currently the
case in <tt>pbrt</tt>.

<li> Displacement mapping, where geometry is subdivided into small
triangles, which can then have their vertices perturbed procedurally or with
texture maps, can be more easily implemented if all primitives are able to
tessellate themselves.
</ul><p>


</p>
<p>These advantages are substantial, for both increased performance and the
complexity that they remove from many parts of the system.  For a production
renderer, rather than one with pedagogical goals like <tt>pbrt</tt>, this
alternative is worth considering carefully. (Alternatively,
triangles alone could be given special treatment&mdash;stored directly in
acceleration structures and so forth&ndash;while other shapes were handled with
a less efficient general purpose code path.)

</p>
<p>Given well-built acceleration structures, a strength of ray tracing is that
the time spent on ray&ndash;primitive intersections grows slowly with added scene
complexity.  As such, the maximum complexity that a ray tracer can handle may
be limited more by memory than by computation.  Because rays may pass through
many different regions of the scene during a short period of time, virtual
memory often performs poorly when ray tracing complex scenes due to the
resulting incoherent memory access patterns.

</p>
<p>One way to increase the potential complexity that a renderer is capable of
handling is to reduce the memory used to store the scene.  For example,
<tt>pbrt</tt> currently uses approximately 4&nbsp;GB of memory for the 24 million
triangles in the landscape scene on the cover and in
Figure&nbsp;<a href="../Primitives_and_Intersection_Acceleration.html#fig:ecosys-instancing">4.1</a>.  This works out to an average of 167
bytes per triangle.  We have previously written ray tracers that managed an
average of 40 bytes per triangle for scenes like these&mdash;at least a <svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="2.971ex" height="2.176ex" style="vertical-align: -0.338ex;" viewBox="0 -791.3 1279 936.9" role="img" focusable="false" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="MathJax-SVG-1-Title">

</g>
</svg> reduction is possible.

</p>
<p>Reducing memory overhead requires careful attention to memory use
throughout the system. For example, in the aforementioned system, we provided three
different <a href="../Shapes/Triangle_Meshes.html#Triangle"><tt>Triangle</tt></a> implementations, one using 8-bit <tt>uint8_t</tt>s
to store vertex indices, one using 16-bit <tt>uint16_t</tt>s, and one using
32-bit <tt>uint32_t</tt>s.  The smallest index size that was sufficient for the
range of vertex indices in the mesh was chosen at run time.  Deering&rsquo;s
paper on geometry compression (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Deering95">Deering 1995</a>) and Ward&rsquo;s packed color
format (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Ward92">Ward 1992</a>) are both good inspirations for thinking along
these lines.  See the &ldquo;Further Reading&rdquo; section in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="../Primitives_and_Intersection_Acceleration.html#chap:acceleration">4</a> for
information about more memory-efficient acceleration structure
representations.

</p>
<p>A more complex approach to implement is geometry caching (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Pharr96">Pharr and Hanrahan 1996</a>),
where the renderer holds a fixed amount of geometry in memory and discards
geometry that hasn&rsquo;t been accessed recently.  This approach is useful for
scenes with a lot of tessellated geometry, where a compact higher level
shape representation like a subdivision surface can explode into a large
number of triangles.  When available memory is low, some of this geometry
can be discarded and regenerated later if needed.
Geometry stored on
disk can also be loaded into geometry caches; with the advent of economical
flash storage offering hundreds of megabytes per second of read bandwidth,
this approach is even more attractive.

</p>
<p>The performance of such a cache can be substantially improved by reordering
the rays that are traced in order to improve their spatial and thus memory
coherence (Pharr et al. <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Pharr97">1997</a>).  An easier-to-implement and
more effective approach to improving the cache&rsquo;s behavior was described by
Christensen et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Christensen03">2003</a>), who wrote a ray tracer that uses simplified
representations of the scene geometry in a geometry cache.  More recently,
Yoon et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:yoonrlod">2006</a>), Budge et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Budge09">2009</a>), Moon et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Moon2010">2010</a>), and Hanika et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Hanika2010">2010</a>) have developed improved approaches to this problem.  See
Rushmeier, Patterson, and Veerasamy (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Rushmeier:1993:GSF">1993</a>) for an
early example of how to use simplified scene representations when computing
indirect illumination.

</p>
<p>Rendering high-quality imagery for film introduces a host of challenges
beyond the topics discussed in this book.  Being able to render
highly complex scenes&mdash;with both geometric and texture complexity&mdash;is a
requirement.  Most production renderers have deferred loading and caching of
texture and geometry at the hearts of their implementations.  Programmable
surface shaders are also critical for allowing users to specify complex
material appearances.

</p>
<p>Another practical challenge is integrating with interactive modeling and
shading tools: it&rsquo;s important that artists be able to quickly see the
effect of changes that they make to models, surfaces, and lights.  Deep
integration with tools is necessary for this to work well&mdash;communicating
the scene description from scratch with a text file each time the
scene is rendered, as is done in <tt>pbrt</tt>, is not a viable approach.

</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the developers of most of the current crop of production rendering systems
haven&rsquo;t yet followed the lead of Cook et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Cook87">1987</a>), who described Reyes and
its design in great detail.  Exceptions include PantaRay, which was used by
Weta Digital and is described by Pantaleoni et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Pantaleoni2010">2010</a>), and Disney&rsquo;s
Hyperion renderer (Eisenacher et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Eisenacher2013">2013</a>).

</p>
<p>The OptiX ray-tracing system, which is described by Parker et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Parker2010">2010</a>),
has a very interesting system structure: it&rsquo;s a combination of built-in
functionality (e.g., for building acceleration structures and traversing
rays through them) that can be extended by user-supplied code (for
primitive implementations, surface shading functions, etc.). Many renderers
over the years have allowed user extensibility of this sort, usually
through some kind of plug-in architecture. OptiX is distinctive in that
it is built using a run-time compilation system that compiles all of this
code together.

</p>
<p>Because the compiler has a view of the entire system when generating code,
the resulting custom renderer can be automatically specialized in a variety
of ways. For example, if the surface shading code never uses the <svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="5.301ex" height="2.843ex" style="vertical-align: -0.838ex;" viewBox="0 -863.1 2282.2 1223.9" role="img" focusable="false" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="MathJax-SVG-1-Title">

texture coordinates, the code that computes them in the triangle shape
intersection test can be optimized out as dead code.  Or, if the ray&rsquo;s time
field is never accessed, both the code that sets it and even the structure
member itself can be eliminated.  Thus, this approach allows a degree of
specialization (and resulting performance) that would be difficult to
achieve manually, at least for more than a single system variant.
