<h2>17.2 Alternative Hardware Architectures</h2><p>


</p>
<p>Our focus in this book has been on traditional multi-core CPUs as a target
for the system.  Furthermore, we have ignored the potential of being able
to perform up to eight floating-point operations per instruction by using CPU
SIMD hardware.  While other computing architectures like GPUs or
specialized ray-tracing hardware are appealing targets
for a renderer, their characteristics tend
to change rapidly, and their programming languages and models are less
widely known than languages like C++ on CPUs. Though we haven&rsquo;t targeted
these architectures with <tt>pbrt</tt>, it&rsquo;s useful to discuss their
characteristics.

</p>
<p>The early days of ray tracing saw work in this area focused on
multiprocessors (Cleary et al. <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Cleary:1983:DAA">1983</a>;
<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Green:1989:ECF">Green and Paddon 1989</a>; <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Badouel:1989:AEP">Badouel and Priol 1989</a>) and clusters of computers
(Parker et&nbsp;al. <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Parker:1999:IRT">1999</a>; Wald et al. <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald01a">2001a</a>, <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald02">2002</a>; <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald01b">Wald et&nbsp;al. 2001b</a>;
<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald03">Wald et&nbsp;al. 2003</a>).  More recently, substantial capabilities have become
available in single computer systems, which has led to a shift of focus to
the capabilities of CPU SIMD units and GPUs.

</p>
<p>CPUs have long been designed to run a single thread of computation as
efficiently as possible; these processors can be considered to be latency
focused, in that the goal is to finish a single computation as quickly as
possible.  (Only since 2005 or so has this focus started to slowly change
in CPU design, as multicore CPUs have provided a small number of
independent latency-focused processors on a single chip.)  Starting with
the advent of programmable graphics processors around the year 2003,
<em>throughput processors</em> (as exemplified by GPUs) have increasingly
become the source of most of the computational capability available in
many computer systems.  These processors focus not on
single-thread performance but instead on efficiently running hundreds or
thousands of computations in parallel with high aggregate computational
throughput, without trying to minimize time for any of the individual
computations.

</p>
<p>By not focusing on single-thread performance, throughput processors are
able to devote much less space on the chip for caches, branch prediction
hardware, out-of-order execution units, and other features that have been
invented to improve single-thread performance on CPUs.  Thus, given a
fixed amount of chip area, these processors are able to provide many more
arithmetic logic units (ALUs) than a CPU.  For the types of computations
that can provide a substantial amount of independent parallel work,
throughput processors can keep these ALUs busy and very efficiently execute
the computation.  As of the time of writing, GPUs offer
approximately ten times as many peak FLOPS as high-end CPUs; this makes
them highly attractive for many processing-intensive tasks (including ray
tracing).<button style="button" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" data-html="true" class="btn footnote-button" title="However, graphics processors typically consume more
  power and are physically larger chips than CPUs; some of their improved
  performance comes purely from using more power and more chip area.  A
  fair comparison is to consider performance per watt or per square
  millimeter of silicon, which puts GPUs at 3-5x more capable in
  terms of peak performance.">
      <sup>&dagger;</sup>
    </button>
		

</p>
<p>Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) processing, where processing units
execute a single instruction across multiple data elements, is the key
mechanism that throughput processors use to efficiently deliver
computation; both today&rsquo;s CPUs and today&rsquo;s GPUs have SIMD
vector units in their processing cores.  Modern CPUs generally have a
handful of processing cores and support four
or eight 32-bit floating point operations in their vector instruction sets
(e.g., SSE, NEON, or AVX). GPUs currently have tens of processing cores,<button style="button" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" data-html="true" class="btn footnote-button" title="The
  definition of a &ldquo;core&rdquo; on a throughput processor is notoriously tricky,
  with different hardware vendors promoting different definitions.  Here, we
  are following the relatively vendor-neutral terminology proposed by
  Fatahalian (2008).">
      <sup>&dagger;</sup>
    </button>
		 each with SIMD vector units between 8 and 64
elements wide.  (Intel&rsquo;s Xeon Phi architecture, which features over 50
relatively simple CPU cores, each with a 16-wide 32-bit floating-point SIMD unit,
lies somewhere between these two points.)
It is likely that both the number of processing cores and
the width of the vector units in all of
these processor architectures will go up over time, as hardware designers make use of
additional transistors made possible by Moore&rsquo;s law.

</p>
<p>Purcell et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Purcell:2002:RTO">2002</a>, <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Purcell:2003:PMO">2003</a>) and Carr, Hall, and Hart (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Carr2002">2002</a>) were the first
to map general-purpose ray tracers to throughput graphics processors.
GPU-based construction of data structures tends to be challenging; see Zhou et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Zhou08">2008</a>), Lauterbach et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Lauterbach09">2009</a>), Pantaleoni and Luebke (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Pantaleoni2010a">2010</a>),
Garanzha et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Garanzha2011">2011</a>), and Karras and Aila (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Karras2013">2013</a>) for techniques for
building kd-trees and BVHs on GPUs.

</p>
<p>Aila and Laine (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Aila09">2009</a>) carefully investigated the performance of SIMD ray
tracing on a graphics processor, using their insights to develop a new
SIMD-friendly traversal algorithm that was substantially more efficient
than the previous best known approach.  Their insights are worth careful
consideration by all implementors of high-performance rendering systems.

</p>
<p>A big challenge in using throughput processors for rendering systems can be
finding coherent collections of computation that use
the SIMD vector elements efficiently.  Consider a
Monte Carlo path tracer tracing a collection of rays; after random sampling
at the first bounce, each ray will in general intersect completely
different objects, likely with completely different surface shaders.  At
this point, running the surface shaders will likely make poor use of SIMD
hardware as each ray needs to execute a different computation.
This specific problem of efficient shading was investigated by
Hoberock et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Hoberock09">2009</a>), who re-sorted a large number of intersection points
to create coherent collections of work before executing their surface
shaders.

</p>
<p>Another challenge is that relatively limited amount of local memory on GPUs
makes it challenging to implement light transport algorithms that require
more than a small amount of storage for each ray.  (For example, even
storing all of the vertices of a pair of subpaths for a bidirectional path
tracing algorithm is not straightforward.)  The paper by Davidovi<span>&#269;</span> et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:xEntityList:Davidovicmd:v:c2014">2014</a>) gives a thorough overview of these issues and previous work
and includes a discussion of implementations of a number of sophisticated
light transport algorithms on the GPU.

</p>
<p>An interesting trade-off for renderer developers to consider is exhibited
by Hachisuka&rsquo;s path tracer, which uses a rasterizer with parallel
projection to trace rays, effectively computing visibility in the same
direction for all of the points being shaded (Hachisuka&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Hachisuka05">2005</a>).  His insight
was that although this approach doesn&rsquo;t give a particularly good sampling
distribution for Monte Carlo path tracing, in that each point isn&rsquo;t able to
perform importance sampling to select outgoing directions, the increased
efficiency from computing visibility for a very coherent collection of rays
paid off overall.  In other words, for a fixed amount of computation, so
many more samples could be taken using rasterization versus using ray
tracing that the much larger number of less well-distributed samples
generated a better image than a smaller number of well-chosen samples.  We
suspect that this general issue of trading off between computing exactly
the locally desired result at a single point versus computing what can be
computed very efficiently globally for many points will be an important one
for developers to consider on the SIMD processors of the future.

</p>
<p>For narrow SIMD widths on CPUs (like four-element SSE), some performance
gains can be attained by opportunistically using the SIMD unit.  For
example, one might modify <tt>pbrt</tt> to use SSE instructions for the operations
defined in the <a href="../Color_and_Radiometry/Spectral_Representation.html#Spectrum"><tt>Spectrum</tt></a> class, thus generally being able to do three
floating-point operations per instruction (for RGB spectra) rather than
just one if the SIMD unit was not used.  This approach would achieve 75%
utilization of an SSE unit for those instructions but doesn&rsquo;t help with
performance in the rest of the system.  In some cases, optimizing compilers
can identify multiple computations in scalar code that can be executed
together using a single SIMD instruction.

</p>
<p>Achieving <em>excellent</em> utilization of SIMD vector units generally requires that the
entire computation be expressed in a <em>data parallel</em> manner, where the
same computation is performed on many data elements simultaneously.
A natural way to extract data parallelism in a ray tracer is to have each

least the size of the SIMD width, if not larger; as such, each SIMD
vector &ldquo;lane&rdquo; is responsible for just a single ray, and each vector instruction
performs only a single scalar computation for each of the rays it&rsquo;s
responsible for. Thus, high SIMD utilization comes naturally, except for the
cases where some rays require different computations than others.

</p>
<p>This approach has seen success with high-performance CPU ray tracers (where
it is generally called &ldquo;packet tracing&rdquo;).  Wald et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald01a">2001a</a>) introduced
this approach, which has since seen wide adoption.  In a packet tracer, the

</g>
</svg> rays that are then processed as a
unit.  Acceleration structure traversal algorithms are modified so that
they visit a node if <em>any</em> of the rays in the packet passes through it;
primitives in the leaves are tested for intersection with all of the rays
in the packet, and so forth.  Packet tracing has been shown to lead to
substantial speedups, although it becomes increasingly less effective as the
rays to be traced become less coherent; it works well for camera rays and
shadow rays to localized light sources, since the packets of rays will pass
through similar regions of the scene, but efficiency generally falls off
with multi-bounce light transport algorithms.  Finding ways to retain good
efficiency with packet tracing remains an active area of research.

</p>
<p>Packet tracing on CPUs is usually implemented with the SIMD vectorization
made explicit: intersection functions are written to explicitly take some
number of rays as a parameter rather than just a single ray, and so forth.
In contrast, the vectorization in programs written for throughput
processors like GPUs is generally implicit: code is written as if it just
operates on a single ray at a time, but the underlying compiler and
hardware actually execute one instance of the program in each SIMD lane.

</p>
<p>For processors that directly expose their SIMD nature in their instruction
sets (like CPUs or Intel&rsquo;s Xeon Phi), the designer of the programming model
is able to choose whether to provide an implicit or an explicit vector model to
the user.  See Parker et&nbsp;al.&rsquo;s (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Parker07">2007</a>) ray-tracing shading
language for an example of compiling an implicitly data-parallel language
to a SIMD instruction set on CPUs.  See also Georgiev and Slusallek&rsquo;s (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Georgiev08">2008</a>) approach, where a generic programming approach is taken in C++ to
allow implementing a high-performance ray tracer with details like packets
well hidden.  <tt>ispc</tt>, described in a paper by Pharr and Mark (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Pharr2012">2012</a>),
provides a general-purpose &ldquo;single program multiple data&rdquo; (SPMD) language
for CPU vector units that also provides this model.

</p>
<p>Reshetov et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:mlrt05">2005</a>) generalized packet
tracing, showing that gathering up many rays from a single origin into a
frustum and then using the frustum for acceleration structure traversal
could lead to very high-performance ray tracing; they refined the frusta
into subfrusta and eventually the individual rays as they reached lower
levels of the tree.  Reshetov (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Reshetov07">2007</a>) later introduced a technique for efficiently
intersecting a collection of rays against a collection of triangles in
acceleration structure leaf nodes by generating a frustum around the rays
and using it for first-pass culling.  See Benthin and Wald (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Benthin09">2009</a>) for a technique to use ray frusta and packets for
efficient shadow rays.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>While packet tracing is effective for coherent collections of rays that
follow generally the same path through acceleration structures, it&rsquo;s much
less effective for incoherent collections of rays, which are more common with
global illumination algorithms.  To address this issue, Christensen et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Christensen2006">2006</a>),
Ernst and Greiner (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Ernst2008">2008</a>), Wald et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald2008">2008</a>), and Dammertz et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Dammertz2008">2008</a>) proposed only
traversing a single ray through the acceleration structure at once
but improving SIMD efficiency by simultaneously testing each ray against a number of
bounding boxes at each step in the hierarchy. 

</p>
<p>Another approach to the ray incoherence problem is to reorder small batches
of incoherent rays to improve SIMD efficiency; representative work in this
area includes papers by Mansson et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Mansson07">2007</a>), Boulos et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Boulos08">2008</a>),
Gribble and Ramani (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Gribble08">2008</a>), and Tsakok (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Tsakok09">2009</a>).  More recently, Barringer and Akenine-M&ouml;ller (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Barringer2014">2014</a>) developed a SIMD ray traversal algorithm that
delivered substantial performance improvements given large numbers of rays.

<p>The Embree system, described in a paper by Wald et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald2014">2014</a>), is a
high-performance open source rendering system that supports both packet
tracing and highly efficient traversal of single rays.  See also the paper
by Benthin et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Benthin2011">2011</a>) on the topic of finding a balance between these
two approaches.

</p>
<p><tt>pbrt</tt> is very much a &ldquo;one ray at a time&rdquo; ray tracer; if a rendering
system can provide many rays for intersection tests at once, a variety of
more efficient implementations are possible even beyond packet tracing.
For example, Keller and W&auml;chter (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Keller2011">2011</a>) and Mora (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Mora2011">2011</a>) described
algorithms for intersecting a large number of rays against the scene
geometry where there is no acceleration structure at all. Instead,
primitives and rays are both recursively partitioned until small
collections of rays and small collections of primitives remain, at which
point intersection tests are performed.  Improvements to this approach were
described by &Aacute;fra (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:xEntityList:cmd::Afra2012">2012</a>) and Nabata et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Nabata2013">2013</a>).

</p>
<p>Given the widespread success of specialized hardware for triangle
rasterization and shading in modern PCs, there has long been interest in
designing specialized hardware for ray tracing.  The ray-tracing algorithm
presents a variety of stages of computation that must be addressed
in a complete system, including camera ray generation, construction of the acceleration
hierarchy, traversal of the hierarchy, ray&ndash;primitive intersections,
shading, lighting, and integration calculations.

</p>
<p>Early published work in this area includes a paper by Woop et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Woop2005">2005</a>),
who described the design of a &ldquo;ray processing unit&rdquo; (RPU).  More
recently, Aila and Karras (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Aila2010">2010</a>) described general architectural issues
related to handling incoherent rays, as are common with global illumination
algorithms.  Nah et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Nah2011">2011</a>) and Lee and collaborators (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Lee2013">2013</a>, <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Lee2015">2015</a>) have
written a series of papers on ray tracing on a mobile GPU architecture,
addressing issues including hierarchy traversal, ray generation,
intersection calculations, and ray reordering for better memory coherence.
See also the paper by Doyle et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Doyle2013">2013</a>) on SAH BVH construction in
specialized hardware.

</p>
<p>While there has been substantial research work in this area, unfortunately
none of these architectures has made it out to the market in large
numbers, though the Caustic ray-tracing architecture (McCombe&nbsp;<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:McCombe2013">2013</a>) has
been acquired by a mobile GPU vendor, Imagination Technologies.  Plans for
products based on an integration of this architecture into a traditional
GPU have been announced; we are hopeful that the time
for efficient ray-tracing hardware may have arrived.

<span id="TheFuture"></span><h3>17.2.4  The Future</h3><p>


</p>
<p>Innovation in high-performance architectures for graphics seems likely to
continue in coming years.  As CPUs are gradually increasing their SIMD
width and adding more processing cores, becoming more similar to throughput
processors, throughput processors are adding support for task parallelism
and improving their performance on more irregular workloads than purely
data-parallel ones.  Whether the computer system of the future is a
heterogeneous collection of both types of processing cores or whether there
is a middle ground with a single type of processor architecture that works
well for a range of applications remains an open question.

</p>
<p>The role of specialized fixed-function graphics hardware in future systems
is likely to become increasingly important; fixed-function hardware is
generally substantially more power-efficient than programmable hardware.
As the critical computational kernels of future graphics systems become
clear, fixed-function implementations of them may become widespread.
